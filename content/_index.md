Here I'm writing blogs on things I've thought about while developing audio software and whatever computer-related stuff I feel like writing about.

### About Me

I'm the lead developer of the [Meadowlark](https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Meadowlark) application, which aims to be a fully-featured, free and open source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). I'm also the lead developer of the [RustyDAW](https://github.com/RustyDAW) project, which is what Meadowlark is built on.

If you want to chat, I am most active on the [Meadowlark Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2W3Xvc8wy4) and the [Rust Audio Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Qs2Zwtf9Gf). There are also a lot of other cool Rusty developers there as well.

I've compiled a handy and extensive list of audio DSP and development resources in an awesome list called [Awesome-Audio-DSP](https://github.com/BillyDM/Awesome-Audio-DSP). ðŸŽ§
