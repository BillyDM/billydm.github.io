Here I'm writing blogs on things I've thought about while developing audio software and whatever computer-related stuff I feel like writing about.

### About Me

---

I'm the lead developer of the [Meadowlark](https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Meadowlark) application, which aims to be a fully-featured, free and open source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)

If you want to chat, I am most active on the [Meadowlark Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2W3Xvc8wy4). I am also active in the [Rust Audio Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Qs2Zwtf9Gf), where you can also find a lot of other cool Rusty audio developers as well.

##### *"Where can I learn more about audio DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and audio software development?"*

---

I've compiled a handy and extensive list of audio DSP and development resources in an awesome list called [Awesome-Audio-DSP](https://github.com/BillyDM/Awesome-Audio-DSP). ðŸŽ§
